Claire the Explain Bear ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension that helps users understand text by providing explanations powered by OpenAI's API. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

1. **Data We Collect**
- **Highlighted Text**: When you highlight text on a webpage and click "Explain," the selected text is sent to OpenAI's API to generate an explanation.
- **Page Content**: Depending on your context settings, portions of the webpage content (or the entire page) may be sent to OpenAI to provide context for the explanation.
- **Additional Prompt**: If you provide an additional prompt in the "Explain Further" feature, this text is also sent to OpenAI.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Your API key is stored locally in Chrome storage (`chrome.storage.sync`) and is used to authenticate requests to OpenAI. It is not shared with any other parties.

2. **How We Use Your Data**
- The highlighted text, page content, and additional prompts are sent to OpenAI's API to generate explanations.
- We do not store or log any of this data on our servers. All processing happens between your browser and OpenAI's API.

3. **Third-Party Services**
- **OpenAI**: The Extension uses OpenAI's API to generate explanations. Your data (highlighted text, page content, additional prompts) is sent to OpenAI for processing. Please review OpenAI's privacy policy (https://openai.com/privacy) for details on how they handle your data.
- **Flaticon**: The bear icon used in the Extension is provided by Freepik via Flaticon. No user data is shared with Flaticon.

4. **Data Storage**
- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in Chrome storage and is encrypted by Chrome. It is only accessed to make API requests on your behalf.
- No other user data is stored by the Extension.

5. **Your Choices**
- You can manage how much context is sent to OpenAI via the context settings in the Extension's options page.
- You can remove your API key from the options page at any time to stop API requests.

6. **Security**
- We do not log or store your API key or any user data. However, since the API key is stored in Chrome storage, ensure your device is secure to prevent unauthorized access.

7. **Changes to This Policy**
- We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.

8. **Contact Us**
- If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at [your-email@example.com].
